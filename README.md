## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of the sub part of the online dashboard which uses BERT and other text based pretrained models for sentiment analysis.
## Project Background
In the evolving landscape of Human Resources, capturing and understanding employee sentiment is crucial for fostering a positive work environment and making informed decisions. Traditional survey analysis methods can be time-consuming and insufficient for capturing the depth of employee sentiments. Our project aims to develop an automated tool that integrates sentiment analysis, visualization technologies, and generative AI to address these challenges.
